# e155-project-portfolio
This website outlines the entire scope of the Barcode Beats final project for E155: Microprocessor Design and Application at Harvey Mudd College. The project abstract and motivation can be found on the "Home" page. More information regarding the project's authors, including relevant links to their resources, is available on the "Meet the Team" section. The FPGA's design and application, including SPI communication protocols, is found in the "FPGA Design" tab. Similar information regarding the MCU's purpose and design selection is found in the "MCU Design" section. The "Documentation" section links the GitHub repository for FPGA, MCU, and MATLAB code, and provides the schematics and block diagrams necessary to understand the flow of the entire system. The project's specifications and justifications for how they are met through scope traces, waveforms, and logic analyzer communication is shown in the "Results" section. The "More" section includes key references in the project development and acknowledgements to those who supported us throughout the design process and the class in general.
